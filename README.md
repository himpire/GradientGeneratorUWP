Generates MultiDirectional Gradients
Hello!

In this project I'm trying to work on an application as a tool for better Ui Design with C#;

The main goal  is to generate MultiDirectional Gradient Brush.
In Adobe Illustrator there is a tool named Freeform Gradient where you can set the posioton of each color stop in a custom way on the plane nor linear nor radial
I needed that brush in my works and I didn't find anything usefull; so, I started to make the version of my own.
